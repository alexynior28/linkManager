linkManager
===========

Link manager is helps you to store any interesting links,  
you find online and want to come back later.
Bookmark sucks.

Link Manaer helps you to archive, filter, edit, and much more coming.

##Goal
_______
Every day you got some awesome link and you try to have a read it.
Sometimes you don't have **enough** time to look into it. 
Or you want to save a nice link which you want to see again.
for another weekend ToDo app. 
or to add some more point in a heated discussion about technology.
or you want to use it any presentation.
or they are too good to loose.
and simple google search will not provide you the result.
as google dont have vague memory or could understand what you can't say.
btw, better history could help little bit but dont serve the purpose.
(sorry for unnecessary 10lines to make a point. Exactly 11 lines including this one.)
