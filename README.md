linkManager
===========

Simple ToDo style (incomplete)app to tryout backbone and bootstrap in a nice weekend

##Goal
_______
Every day you got some awesome link and you try to have a read it.
Sometimes you don't have *enough time to look into it. 
Or you want to save a nice link which you want to see again
for another weekend ToDo app or 
to add some more point in a heated discussion about technology
or you want to use it any presentation
or they are too good to loose
and simple google search will not provide you the result
as google dont have vague memory or could understand what you can't say
btw, better history could help little bit but dont serve the purpose
(sorry for unnecessary 10lines to make a point. Exactly 11 lines including this one.)
